'Simple Weapons' are a category of weapon style that involve very basic know-how, if any, to use. While they can be elevated with the use of combat techniques or modifications, at the end of the day, they are a weighted mass, and/or a pointy stick, without hinges, chains, strange weighting conditions, or upkeep measures for them to work.

Examples of simple weapon styles include:
