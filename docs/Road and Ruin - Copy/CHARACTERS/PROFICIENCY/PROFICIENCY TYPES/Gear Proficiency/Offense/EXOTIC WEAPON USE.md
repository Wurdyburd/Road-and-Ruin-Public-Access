A gear proficiency. Familiarity with unusual weapons improves their use in combat and upkeep efforts. Examples include whips, chains, scythes, or explosives.

As a [[Road and Ruin/CHARACTERS/PROFICIENCY/DISCIPLINE]], these weapons often involve extremely unorthodox methods and skills, and so require specialization in the weapon for intended use.
