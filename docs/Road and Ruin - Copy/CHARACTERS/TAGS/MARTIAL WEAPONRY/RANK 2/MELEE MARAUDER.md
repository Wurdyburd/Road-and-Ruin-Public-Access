INSIGHT: With an experienced eye, trained to detect both skill and weakness, WIT(Rank+Insight) successes grant you knowledge of the physical attributes or offensive proficiencies of an observed target, or a group of comparable targets. This insight reveals to you whether a target's ability is higher, lower, more than double, or less than half of your own.

COMBAT: Gain 1 Exertion point to spend on combat actions each round, +1 per round beyond the first where you have attacked, or been attacked, up to a total maximum equal to your rank.

- R3: Distraction no longer imposes a movement penalty. Gain Reactive Haste with proficient melee weapons.
- R4: Melee attacks against targets you have insight on, and skill checks to further enable combat, no longer suffers a Distraction penalty.
- R5: Every four strikes you inflict or suffer via melee weapons grants you one point of Rage.
