You want to travel the world! Whether wandering quiet forest paths, scaling mountain heights, traveling to the sea, or to visit far-flung ruins or cities, you manifest the true spirit of adventure.

As an Explorer, your games often involve the widest array of content, in terms of both geographical scale and the meaningfulness of what you find within it.

Some proficiencies that may help you:

| [[ATHLETICS]], [[BALANCE]], and [[DRIFT]]             | Keeping your balance is important, especially if you're expecting to go running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and more in nature's personal junglegym.                                                                                                                              |

Playing an Explorer is about looking for an escape, either from a dreary origin or a troubled past, or in pursuit of greener pastures. While you may have a reason that brought you here, the thrill of adventure and intrigue of discovery can easily push you into new environments and encounters, and you tend to be more open-minded to all the strange and myriad ways for a person to be.
