When playing Road and Ruin, whether by constructing a narrative, exploring, or simulating the effects of a battle, it helps to be able to take your places once you've set a scene.

Road and Ruin has multiple levels of granularity for operating within different scopes of distance, depending on the importance of positioning, and your preference.

Loosely: it is less important that overly specific measurements come into play, and more important that events are allowed to unfold that tell a compelling narrative. For this reason, while distances can be measured in grids for the sake of information visualization, actual events are measured in Effective Range. This is to help to account for creatures of significantly differing sizes and speeds; a 100ft tall giant may have difficulty performing on the same board as a 2" tall pixie, and vice versa.

Note that all of the below ranges are measured in STANDARD. Translate these distances up and down relative to the amount of distance a creature can casually travel over the course of three seconds as necessary.

## DESCRIBING DISTANCE AND DISTANCE

When using environments, travel, and range, two major schools of thought take precedent:

### GRID PLAY.
- The most precise of navigational and positioning methods, this renders the world as an evenly spaced hexagonal grid.
- When characters move from one location to another, they move between connected hextiles in a line, potentially spending resources to do so.
- Each tile is consider to be capable of containing a certain degree of information, such as what creatures or objects occupy that space, what the quality of the ground, air, and light is like, and the relationship the tile has to other tiles, such as changes in height, barricades and walls, and line of sight.
- This form of measurement is best suited to smaller, precise spaces, ideally within 100m wide.

### APPROXIMATE DISTANCE, THEATRES, and STAGES
- Stage-play is as it sounds: the characters, or actors, are visualized on a stage. They're to deliver their lines, wander between each other, and engage in sword-clashing duels.
- Several stages may be in place at once, or switch locations with a chance of scene.
- Grouping several events, stages, locations, and scenes together forms a chapter, or a theatre.
- While resources are still spent to travel from place to place, the borders of a play grid fall away, so that the world might be more narratively engaged with.
- Rather than being defined by the grid, the map is defined by scenery: Doors, Halls, Corners, Rooms, Ledges, and so on represent travel, separated by Near, Closeby, Far, Very Far, or Too Far distances.



Here are an example of each in identical use, where an adventuring party comes across a foe while exploring an ancient ziggurat:
