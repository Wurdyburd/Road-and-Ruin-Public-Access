## WHAT IS A CHARACTER?

In the game of Road and Ruin, a character refers to any entity that can perform actions and affect the world or other creatures.
They can include heroes, villains, animals and monsters, gods, or simply people trying to carry on in an unforgiving world.

Characters are defined by a combination of physical, mental, and social traits, skills, past experiences, beliefs, and belongings, such as keepsakes, equipment, or property, and may be able to cast spells.
