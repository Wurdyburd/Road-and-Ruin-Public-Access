A mental proficiency. The knowledge, expertise, appraisement, and consistency of speed, power, precision, and performance of processing materials, building of structures, repair, and quality of appearance.

While simple repairs or quality evaluation can be done during the day-by-day, attempting activities that require specific techniques or know-how of rare or unusual materials, without the appropriate specialization as a [[DISCIPLINE]], can only produce [[IMPROVISED]] results, with equipment breakage, or even severe injury as a result of shoddy craftsmanship, or disgusting or disturbing the target audience in some way.
