A physical proficiency. The knowledge and experience of natural spaces and hazards. Used in the securing of food, water, shelter, and warmth, risk assessment for avoidance of natural hazards, such as rock or wood stability, predators, or poisons, venoms, disease, or rot.

General survival methods and knowledge can apply here, but for survival in a location that you do not actively live in or intentionally and frequently engage with, specialization is required, as a [[DISCIPLINE]].
