A social proficiency. An art for entertainment, pastime, income, or distraction. May be lasting, in the form of Crafts, or temporary, such as music or dance.

While not explicitly requiring specialization to be entertaining, often, entertainment is nuanced, or based on novelty. As a [[DISCIPLINE]], specialization ensures that you can consistently produce the desired results.
