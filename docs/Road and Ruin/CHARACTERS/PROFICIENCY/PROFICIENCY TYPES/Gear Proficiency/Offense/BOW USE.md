A gear proficiency. Familiarity with the draw weight, flight speed, and ammunition weight of a bow and arrow improves it's use as a projectile weapon and upkeep efforts.

Lack of bow proficiency erodes success threshold by 5.

As a [[DISCIPLINE]], this weapon requires specialization to use, given the unorthodox method of accelerating and aiming the ammunition.
