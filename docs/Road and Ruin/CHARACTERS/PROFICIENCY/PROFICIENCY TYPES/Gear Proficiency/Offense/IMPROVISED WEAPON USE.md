A physical proficiency. A generalized knowledge of material properties such as weight, hardness, and splintering, shattering, or sharpness, which grants improved use as a weapon.

Each proficiency level of Improvised Weapon Use can only reduce the Bad Luck penalty of [[IMPROVISED]] equipment use by 1, rather than strictly adding proficiency as a bonus.
