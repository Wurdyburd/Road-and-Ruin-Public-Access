A crisp chill and smell of promised rain lingers on the stone, a tattered pennant snapping in the occasional breeze.*<br><br>*The shadows gather. Firelight marks the threshold of what some consider safety. But it is your burning expectation and anticipation of what tomorrow brings that truly warms you.* |

Welcome to the Road and Ruin wiki! This project intends to catalogue and interlink the various components of the storytelling roleplaying game of action, adventure, mystery, intrigue, exploration, or building simulator.

Take on the role of warriors and adventurers, researchers, nobles, tradesfolk and magicians as each attempts to carve out a place of their own in a world that is not so much fraught with peril, as it is mysterious, magical, and changing ever by the day.

## HOW THIS BOOK WORKS

Road and Ruin is a complex, adaptive, and generative platform designed to create interactive stories, or a ***Tale***, for you and your companions to experience. By the designs of the ***Host***, who works the machinations of the group into larger, more complex narratives, or by the ***Round Table*** system, giving everyone an equal opportunity to shape the adventure, the World of Ruin shifts, mutates, and evolves with every player added or removed from the experience.

The main components of the game are thus:
- CONSTRUCTING A STORY: A game in and of itself, these mechanics cover TALES, and ROLES, as tools for generating a narrative.
- CHARACTER CREATION: These options cover the RACE, CLASS, TAG, SKILL, PROFICIENCY, EQUIPMENT, SPELLS, RELATIONSHIPS, and BELIEFS of any being who helps fulfill a Role in the story.
- CONFLICT RESOLUTION: By merit of rolling dice to produce OUTCOME results influenced by both the CONTEXT of an event, a character's abilities, and SITUATIONAL MODIFIERS, characters advance a narrative, whether they succeed or fail.
- GENERATIVE CONTENT: Being able to produce characters, creatures, objects, events, themes, twists, and relationships for a story to be fresh and unexpected means that even the Host can enjoy the game from the perspective of a Player, and contribute without the risk of foreknowledge altering their decisions.
