In such cases, other responsibilities may be shared to other players at the table. NOTE: Rotating or primary Host responsibility varies in complexity.

You want to dominate your foes, defend the innocent, or get a really cool trophy and story for the tavern. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f [[CRAFTER]] One's limits can often be overcome by simply using the right tool for the job, and those with better tools, overcome them faster, easier, and with better results. You source your materials, and put in the time, effort, and skill to produce wondrous works. \ud83d\udd76\ufe0f [[SNEAKRET]] You want to achieve your goals having made as little ripples as possible.
